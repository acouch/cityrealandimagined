"Or I'll <em>tune out</em> and put a
'MEAN DOG' sign in front
of all my communications!"

      Philadelphia Filmaker

what isn't
fluvial (?) our
planet on currents
of an expanding
universe I'm
fluent in 
saliva for
approaching
2tone hair his
roving toungue
blood the belly magicks

when will I
vanish at
alll my
want
dear
impatience
city I
Love?

give a
flash take
a flash voice of
helicopter sky
        insists

SHERLOCK: (reading graffiti) What's NFG?
ME: New Found Glory!

bricks rise a cappella
more than another
noun round

I <em>know these</em>
trees Sherlock <em>knows</em>
<em>these</em> flags someone
hallucinated ancient Heruka
here His tigers gnawing
Toyota headlights
inflaming intersections
of suffering
how is it
good to
suffer?
FUCK all
this Catholic
Shiite masochism




Sun flowers painted in

the centery of the city

are grained to commemorate
