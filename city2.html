Spring has been here for

a while &    the India

   wheel isa flower that waves


The Lebanon tree has bent &

is bending still in the wind

In the Shadows of St. Peter, I want to
go in to light a candle for every sin I 
don't believe in. The hallway grows
hands with upturned palms, begging
to finance the sins they can't afford.
Here's a light. I hope this helps.
